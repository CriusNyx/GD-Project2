    message: You should contact Sony and leave us alone. They can send you a new
      PS4 if it was broken normally. I think this is a hardware issue and I cannot
      help you.

    message: Has anything happened to it? You could get a new one from Sony. This
      seems too new to be a hardware problem but that's what it sounds like to me.
